   - Uploads artifacts
   - Fails workflow for high/critical vulnerabilities

2. **Snyk Security Scan Job**
   - Runs `snyk test` with high severity threshold
   - Integrates with GitHub Code Scanning
   - Requires SNYK_TOKEN secret

3. **Dependency Check Job**

   - Verifies package-lock.json integrity
   - Runs production audit

**Behavior:**
- ⛔ Blocks PRs with high/critical vulnerabilities
- 📝 Comments audit results on PRs
- 📁 Uploads artifacts for review
- ⚠️ Warns on moderate severity vulnerabilities
